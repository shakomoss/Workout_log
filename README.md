Sure! Here's a sample **README.md** for your project that outlines the purpose of the app, how to set it up, and how to use it:

# Workout Log Tracker

A simple web application built with **Flask**, **PostgreSQL**, and **GraphQL** that allows users to log their workouts, track their progress, and manage their exercise routines.

## Features

- Add, update, and delete workout entries.
- Track workout type, duration, calories burned, exercises, and current stats.
- View a list of all workouts in a neat and interactive interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask, GraphQL, SQLAlchemy (for database interactions)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (for basic styling)
- **Environment Variables**: Python-dotenv for handling sensitive data like database credentials

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/workout-log-tracker.git
cd workout-log-tracker
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It’s a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```ini
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your-username:your-password@localhost:5432/Workout_log
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

Make sure to replace `your-username`, `your-password`, and `your_secret_key_here` with your actual PostgreSQL credentials and a secret key for the app.

### 5. Set Up the Database

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and a database created. You can use the following commands to set up the database:

```bash
psql -U your-username
```

Create the database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE Workout_log;
```

After that, run the Flask app's database initialization:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

This will create the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database.

### 6. Run the Application

To run the app locally in development mode:

```bash
flask run
```

This will start the app on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can:

- **View Workouts**: The homepage will display all workouts added to the system.
- **Add a Workout**: Navigate to the `Add Workout` page to enter a new workout.
- **Update a Workout**: Edit an existing workout by selecting it from the list and updating its details.
- **Delete a Workout**: Delete a workout by clicking the "Delete" button next to each workout.
